This repository contains my end-to-end solution for forecasting wind turbine power output using weather features. The dataset comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mubashirrahim/wind-power-generation-data-forecasting?resource=download) 
and is adapted to simulate conditions in Ilocos Norte, Philippines, home to the countryâ€™s largest wind farms.

The project is framed around participation in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), where day-ahead forecasts and short-term balancing are critical to minimize penalties from imbalance settlements.

Project Objectives:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze distributions of power and weather features.
- Identify seasonality and patterns (e.g., monthly wind output trends).
- Investigate predictive relationships between wind speed, direction, and output.
- Estimate potential MWh lost during anomalous conditions.
Forecasting Models:
- Hour-ahead model for NGCP grid balancing.
- Day-ahead model for WESM bidding.
- Compare performance across horizons using historical and exogenous variables.
Evaluation & Impact:
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE for accuracy.
- Visualize forecast errors to highlight financial implications of imbalance.
- Translate results into actionable insights for power plant operators.
Methods & Tools:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xgboost
-Forecasting techniques: Time-series regression, Lagged features & weather exogenous variables, Gradient boosting models
